# Simon Game

This is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon game. The game tests your memory by generating a sequence of colors that you must repeat in the correct order.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** Press any key to start the game.
2. **Watch the Pattern:** The game will highlight a sequence of colors, starting with one and increasing by one color each round.
3. **Repeat the Pattern:** Click the buttons in the same order as the sequence.
4. **Level Up:** If you correctly repeat the pattern, you move to the next level, where the sequence gets longer.
5. **Game Over:** If you click the wrong color, the game is over, and you can restart by pressing any key.
